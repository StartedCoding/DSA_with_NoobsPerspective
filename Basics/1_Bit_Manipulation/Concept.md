#### The first question that comes to my mind is:
## What is Bit ?
At the deepest level, computer is just an electronic machine.

Inside CPU / memory → only electric signals exist.

There can be two possibilities:
- Current flowing -> ON
- No current -> OFF

So that means, hardware can reliably represent only two states.

We call them:
```vbnet
ON  -> 1
OFF -> 0
```
Thst's it.

This is the physical origin of bit.
